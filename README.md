# Advent of Code 2024 (C++)

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the annual Advent of Code programming challenge, where I tackle a new problem each day throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where a new programming puzzle is released every day from December 1st to December 25th. The challenges vary in difficulty and typically involve a mix of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. It's a fun and rewarding way to improve your coding skills while exploring new concepts!
